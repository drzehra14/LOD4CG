# Linked Open Data for Cancer Genomics

The LOD4CG, is an initiative for experts from biomedical, life sciences and health care domains concerned with cancer data.

# LOD4CG Datasets: 

* COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer): is a comprehensive database for exploring somatic mutations in key cancer
genes across different cancer samples
* CNVD (Copy Number Variation in Disease): is a database that aggregates data from publicly available literature related to
CNV that has been published in recent years. 
* TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas): is a publicly funded project created by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute in 2005 . This project aims to catalogue
the genomic alternations found in all cancers.
